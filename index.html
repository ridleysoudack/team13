      <h1>The Project</h1>
      <p>More and more cities are adopting Green Infrastructure to ease environmental pressures and create beautiful urban environments. An important aspect of Green Infrastructure is the urban forest and urban canopy cover. Canopy cover is an important environmental asset that can positively impact a city's ability to handle climate change, extreme temperature changes, and reduce overall costs for the city.</p>
      <p>The City of Beaumont is a small municipality outside Edmonton, Alberta that has begun to expand its urban canopy cover to take advantage of these benefits. In 2021 the city created the Environmental Master Plan, which outlines how they will assess their environmental services. As part of their Environmental Master Plan, the City of Beaumont requires the current canopy cover to be digitized.  Through Fleming College they have contacted our team to digitize their current canopy cover, create a model that calculates future canopy cover, and develop web-based media to deliver this information.</p>
      <p>The team has worked with Beaumont's current LiDAR data, Aerial Imagery, Tree Inventory, and Base Data to create an interactive web application that visualizes the city's current and future canopy cover. This application simultaneously serves three purposes: to raise awareness on the city's efforts to strengthen their urban forests, to allow the city's employees to access detailed statistics on canopy coverage, and to allow the public to submit service requests for specific trees.</p>
