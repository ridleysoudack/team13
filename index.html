      <h1>The Project</h1>
      <p>More and more cities are adopting Green Infrastructure to ease environmental pressures and create beautiful urban environments. An important aspect of Green Infrastructure is the urban forest and urban canopy cover. Canopy cover is an important environmental asset that can positively impact a city's ability to handle climate change, extreme temperature changes, and reduce overall costs for the city.</p>
      <p>The City of Beaumont is a small municipality outside Edmonton, Alberta that has begun to expand its urban canopy cover to take advantage of these benefits. In 2021 the city created the Environmental Master Plan, which outlines how they will assess their environmental services. As part of their Environmental Master Plan, the City of Beaumont requires the current canopy cover to be digitized.  Through Fleming College they have contacted our team to digitize their current canopy cover, create a model that calculates future canopy cover, and develop web-based media to deliver this information.</p>
      <p>The team has worked with Beaumont's current LiDAR data, Aerial Imagery, Tree Inventory, and Base Data to create an interactive web application that visualizes the city's current and future canopy cover. This application simultaneously serves three purposes: to raise awareness on the city's efforts to strengthen their urban forests, to allow the city's employees to access detailed statistics on canopy coverage, and to allow the public to submit service requests for specific trees.</p>  
      <h3>More information will be available here soon!</h3>

      <h1>Methodology</h1>
      <p>Team.13 identified the following core deliverables that will enable the City of Beaumont to promote and interact with their current and future urban canopy. </p>
      <h3>1 - Canopy Layers</h3>
      <p>First, in order to visualize and model canopy cover we first had to use the client’s LiDAR data to digitize the urban canopy. This was accomplished through using classified high and medium vegetation points to create canopy layers for trees within the cities inventory, and private trees. Once these two canopy layers were created, the public trees were joined with the tree inventory, which had been adjusted to have fields required to model canopy growth over time. This was not possible for the private trees within the city as they had no species information, and therefore it was impossible to obtain data that could be used to model their canopies. Since LiDAR data was from 2017, the canopy cover had to be modelled forward to 2021 using aerial imagery and the created growth model. </p>
      <h3>2 - Canopy Model</h3>
      <p>Before we could model canopy growth species specific characteristics had to be obtained that would allow us to project future canopy expansion. This included maximum spread, maximum height, and growth rate. The current canopy was first modelled forward to 2021 by using the species expected height increase over that duration to calculate the expansion of canopy based on the growth rate of the species. An ArcGIS Notebook was created that uses the same model but adjusted to allow the user to simulate a range of growth conditions, to create projected canopy layers in five, ten, and fifteen years. The created Notebook makes use of the ArcGIS API for Python and can be rerun without breaking integration with the final web experiences. </p>
      <h3>3 - ArcGIS Experiences and Story Map</h3>
      <p>In total two ArcGIS experiences were created, one meant for the cities residents to interact with the urban canopy, and the other for city employee to access advanced statistics on canopy cover. These experiences were created using ArcGIS Experience Builder for Developers to allow us to program a slider widget that allowed the user to view projected canopy in five, ten, and fifteen years. Additionally, a custom theme was created so that the user interface matched the client media. Integrated into both experiences is a Survey123 form that allowed the user to submit service requests on the public side and manage these submissions on the internal side. Finally the team also created a Story Map that highlights the current status of Beaumont’s urban forest, initiatives within the city to promote their canopy, and has an immersive 3D scene that includes public trees and all buildings in the city. </p>
